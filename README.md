This is a full-stack MERN application that uses OpenAI's DALL路E API to generate AI-powered images based on user prompts. The project allows users to create and share unique AI-generated images. Currently the website is down, due to the max free credit limit being exhausted, kindly cooperate as I am working on any alternative.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create images from text prompts using OpenAI's DALL路E API.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
- **Image Sharing**: Browse and share AI-generated images with others.
- **Backend with Cloudinary Integration**: Images are stored and retrieved from Cloudinary.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Built with best practices for scalability and security.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Customizable styling.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between pages.
